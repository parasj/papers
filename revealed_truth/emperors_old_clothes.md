# The Emperor's Old Clothes

**Key ideas**
* Simplicity in system design
* Reliability can only come from simplicity
* Watch out for developer ambition! Developers always strive for complexity
  * "You let your programmers do thigns which you yourself did not understand"
* Avoid comittee based design. It leads to solving problems designed for no single person
  * "There are two ways of constructing a software design: one way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. The first method is far more difficult… It requires a willingness to accept objectives which are limited by physical, logical, and technological constraints, and to accept a compromise when conflicting objectives cannot be met. No committee will ever do this until it is too late."
   * "At first I hoped that such a technically unsound project would collapse but I soon realized it was doomed to success. Almost anything in software can be implemented, sold, and even used given enough determination. There is nothing a mere scientist can say that will stand against the flood of a hundred million dollars. But there is one quality which cannot be purchased in this way – and that is reliability. The price of reliability is the pursuit of the utmost simplicity. It is a price which the very rich find most hard to pay."
* Safety-first design
  * "I was eventually persuaded of the need to design programming notations so as to maximise the number of errors which cannot be made, or if made, can be reliably detected at compile time."


# Programming language design
* "I have regarded it as the highest goal of programming language design to enable good ideas to be elegantly expressed."
* "Programmers are always surrounded by complexity; we cannot avoid it. Our applications are complex because we are ambitious to use our computers in ever more sophisticated ways. Programming is complex because of the large number of conflicting objectives for each of our programming projects. If our basic tool, the language in which we design and code our programs, is also complicated, the language itself becomes part of the problem rather than part of its solution."

# Over-ambition in system design

"Our main failure was overambition… What was amazing was that a large team of highly intelligent programmers could labor so hard and so long on such an unpromising project. You know, you shouldn’t trust us intelligent programmers. We can think up such good arguments for convincing ourselves and each other of the utterly absurd. Especially don’t believe us when we promise to repeat an earlier success, only bigger and better next time."
