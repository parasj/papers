# Toward a Global Data Infrastructure

This paper introduces the concept of the Global Data Plane, a way of managing streams of data in a distributed fashion. GDP addresses the needs of security and privacy, QoS, reducing latency and increased control over data durability. Instead. the GDP advocates a log that stores a data-centric view of the world. Thus, clients can read and write to these logs. Log servers are distrubuted from cloud to edge and a set of routers provide addressability across this network based on the 256-bit addresses.  A log addresses the needs specified earlier as it simplifies authentication and security. It also allows clients to control where they put their data, thereby controlling durability. Finally, the log allows QoS as QoS needs to be managed at the log/queue level instead of per-client. Addressing is solved using Distributed Hash Tables. 

My main critisism of the GDP work is that logs may be insufficient to represent some applications due to efficiency. For many systems, log-based datastructures are less efficient than directly manipulating a materialized view of the DB. For these sensor network applications, I think that the log is a good abstration. But I noticed that such log-based stream approaches were insufficient for finance applications (in a past job) where tight latency guarentees were important. While very different, the GDP routing ideas reminded me of IPFS.
